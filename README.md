# Herb Your Enthusiasm

Your wonderful plants kept you company during the lonely time of covid but as the world gets back to 'normal' they are being a tad forgotten.

Herb Your Enthusiasm is an application that let's you choose from a plant selection to add to your personal garden family. It will send you reminders of when to water and give you a place to keep all of your plant information. Adopt your plant today!!
